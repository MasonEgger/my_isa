0 A B C - Adds the values in registers B and C and stores into register A
1 A B C - Subtracts the values in registers B and C and stores into register A
2 A B C - Multiplys the values in registers B and C and stores into register A
3 A B C - Divides the values in registers B and C and stores into register A
4 A 1 0 - Load Immediate, Loads 1 into A. The 0 is ignored for fixed length instructions
5 A B 0 - Load, Loads into A what is at the memory address stored in B
6 A B 0 - Store, Stores the value of A into the memory address stored in B
7 A 0 0 - In, user input stored into memory address at A
8 A 0 0 - Out, output value in memory address at A
9 A 0 0 - Push. Pushes A onto the stack
10 A 0 0 - Pop. Pops of the stack into A
11 A 0 0 - Jump. Increments the program counter by the value of A (A may be + or -)
12 A B C - Jump if equal. Increments the program counter by the value of A (A may be + or -) if values at B and C are equal

Caveats:
F register can't be used
Registers can be combined
